            Welcome to conkw. There are a few things you can do from there:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="webapp/">Go to the main UI.</a> 
                    <B>Î±</B> This is a development in progress.<br>
                    This UI allows you to easily design dashboards with a point and click interface, along with grabbers configuration & other stuff.
                </li>
                <li><a href="grabbersReference/">Go to the grabber reference.</a> Grabbers are programs that gather
                    data. Either from your computer, form the internet, from anywhere, really. They are what makes
                    conkw so useful. There are already a few grabbers in the default install, so click above to 
                    go check them out. 
                </li>
                <li><a href="/doc/README.html">Go to the documentation.</a> 
                    A great place to learn all about conkw. From basic usage and configuration, reference,  up to the 
                    most advanced customization, it's all there.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/pieroxy/conkw/">Go to the GitHub.</a> 
                    All the code, the documentation, the issues, well, the GitHub.
                </li>
                <li><a href="ui/">Go to the customized UI.</a> 
                    This is <b>your</b> UI. It has been initialized with a few things at installation time,
                    but it's the place for you to build your customized dashboards. The files are in the 
                    <code>ui/</code> directory of the installation folder.
                </li>
            </ul>
