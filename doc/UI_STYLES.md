# conkw documentation - Built-in UI available styles

This documentation is about guidelines on the default UIs. To get to the bottom of everything, press F12 and inspect the default UIs.

## Color set

The default conkw UI uses a set of colors that is dark. Whether it's daytime of nighttime, I feel that's the best theme. 

* The background color is `#000032`
* The text color is white
* The error background color is `#f40`
* The stale text color is `#888`
* The gauge default color is `#adffad`
* The gauge in a warning state is of the color `#800000`

As an example:

* `pieroxy.net` is a regular label
* The `pieroxy.net` gauge is a regular gauge. Its color (the default color) is green.
* `o.i.fr` is a "warning" label
* The `o.i.fr` gauge is a gauge in the warning state. Its color is red.
* `i.fr` is a stale metric.
* The `i.fr` gauge is a gauge in the stale state. Its color is grey.

## Fixed Layout

The default UI is meant to have a layout that fit the entire screen. 


## Columns based layout
