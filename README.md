Web-based conky-like monitoring platform.

## Conky?
Conky is a program I've been using for quite a while. But recently I've been wondering if the real estate consumed by its window was really worth it:

* Either the window is docked and it consumes quite a bit of real estate on the screen.
* Either the window is decorating the desktop background and I never see it.

## Conkw?
Conkw was spawned out of a simple idea: We all have an old laptop or tablet lying around, gathering dust. Why not using this otherwise wasted screen real estate to display my much cherished data I used to have on my old Conky setup?

* The easiest client-server setup is a web server and a browser.
* All tablets and laptops have browsers.
* Every reasonably beefy computer can host a web server.
